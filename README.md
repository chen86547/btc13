Basic principles of transaction in currency-to-crypto trading

The basic principle of transaction: "price first, time first" principle. A high buying price is better than a low buying price, and a lower selling price is better than a higher selling price. When the order prices are the same, orders placed earlier are better than orders placed later. The order is executed.

Limit trading: Users can set a buying price lower than the market price, or a selling price higher than the market price. When the market price reaches the set price, the transaction will be completed.

Market price transaction: Transactions are completed at the current market price, which to a certain extent can ensure that users’ buying and selling orders are completed in a timely manner.
